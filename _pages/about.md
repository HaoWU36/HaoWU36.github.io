Hi, I'm Hao! I'm a postdoc research fellow at National University of Singapore, School of Comptuing. My research is on in-space communication, AI for networking, and system security.

I have many cherished experiences from my time in the Department of Eelectronic Engineering at Tsinghua University, where I got my PhD (supervised by Prof. Jian Yan and Prof. Linling Kuang), Master (supervised by Prof. Jian Yan and Prof. Jianhua Lu), and Bachelor.
