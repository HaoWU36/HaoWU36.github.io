Hi, I'm Hao! I'm a postdoctoral research fellow in [Prateek Saxena](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prateeks/)'s [KISP Lab](https://kisp.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/), National University of Singapore.  

My research focuses on in-space communication, AI for networking, and system security. I'm working on [CAPSTONE](https://capstone.kisp-lab.org/), which aims to build an unified foundation for trustless memory access. 

I have many cherished memories from my time in the [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University, where I received my Ph.D. (supervised by Prof. Jian Yan and Prof. Linling Kuang), M.S. (supervised by Prof. Jian Yan and Prof. Jianhua Lu), and B.S. degrees.
